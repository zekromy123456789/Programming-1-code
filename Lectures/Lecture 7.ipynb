    "### --- First, `list` is a new data type.  \n",
    "### --- Remember how you can index the characters of a `str` using `[ ]`?  You can do the same thing with `list`s.  And just like with `str`s, **zero-based indexing** is employed.\n",
    "### --- You can also do indexing based from the end: e.g., `x[-1]` is the last element of `x`, `x[-2]` is the second-to-last, etc.\n",
    "### --- If you try to read an index that is longer than the length of the list, however, you will get a run-time error.\n",
    "### --- `len()` also works for lists.  \n",
    "### --- You can concatenate `list`s using `+`: this will produce a new `list`, which combines the two operands.\n",
    "### --- And you can multiply a `list` by an integer."
